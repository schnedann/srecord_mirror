       srec_mos_tech - MOS Technology file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  MOS Technology format allows binary files to be uploaded and down-
       loaded between between a computer system (such as a PC,  Macintosh,  or
       workstation)  and  an emulator or evaluation board for microcontrollers
       and microprocessors.

       Each line consists of 5 fields.  These are the  length  field,  address
       field,  data  field,  and  the checksum.  The lines always start with a
       semicolon (;) character.

                   |; | Length | Address | Data | Checksum | CRLF |
                   +--+--------+---------+------+----------+------+
       Length  The record length field is a 2 character (1  byte)  field  that
               specifies  the  number  of data bytes in the record.  Typically
               this is 24 or less.

       Address This is a 2-byte address that specifies where the data  in  the
               record is to be loaded into memory, big-endian.

       Data    The  data  field  contains the executable code, memory-loadable
               data or descriptive information to be transferred.

       Checksum
               The checksum is an 2-byte field that represents the least  sig-
               nificant  two bytes of the the sum of the values represented by
               the pairs of characters making up the record's length, address,
               and data fields, big-endian.

       The  final  line  should  have a data length of zero, and the data line
       count in the address field.  The checksum is not the usual checksum, it
       is instead a repeat of the data line count.

       In  general,  binary  data  will  expand in sized by approximately 2.54
       times when represented with this format.

       Here is an example MOS Technology format file.  It  contains  the  data
       "Hello, World" to be loaded at address 0.

       The paper tape LOAD and DUMP routines store and retrieve data in a spe-
       cific format designed to insure error free recovery.  Each byte of data
       to  be  stored  is  converted to two half bytes.  The half bytes (whose
       possible values are 0 to F HEX) are translated into their ASCII equiva-
       lents and written out onto paper tape in this form.

       Each  record  outputted  begins with a ";" character (ASCII 3B) to mark
       the start of a valid record.  The next byte transmitted (18HEX) or  (24
       decimal)  is  the  number  of  data bytes contained in the record.  The
       record's starting address High (1 byte, 2 characters), starting address
       Lo  (1  byte, 2 characters), and data (24 bytes, 48 characters) follow.
       Each record is terminated by the record's check-sum (2 bytes, 4 charac-
       ters),  a  carriage  return  (ASCII  0D), line feed (ASCII 0A), and six
       "NULL" characters (ASCII 00).  (NULL characters cause a blank  area  on
       the paper tape.)

       The  last record transmitted has zero data bytes (indicated by ;00) The
       starting address field is replaced by a four digit  Hex  number  repre-
       senting the total number of data records contained in the transmission,
       followed by the records usual check-sum digits.   An  "XOFF"  character
       ends the transmission.

       During  a  "LOAD" all incoming data is ignored until a ";" character is
       received.  The receipt of non  ASCII  data  or  a  mismatch  between  a
       records  calculated  check-sum  and  the  check-sum read from tape will
       cause an error condition to be recognized by  KIM.   The  check-sum  is
       calculated by adding all data in the record except the ";" character.

       The  paper tape format described is compatible with all other MOS Tech-
       nology, Inc. software support programs.
