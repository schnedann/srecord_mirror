       srec_dec_binary - DEC Binary (XXDP) file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  DEC  Binary  (XXDP) format was used on the PDP 11 series machines.
       This is a binary format, and is not readable or editable  with  a  text
       editor.  The file consists of records of the form

                  +-----+--------+---------+------------+----------+
                  |type | length | address | ...data... | checksum |
       The field a+r-e--d-e-f+i-n-e-d--a-s--f+o-l-l-o-w-s-:---+------------+----------+

       type    Two byte little-endian value.  Must always be 1.

       length  Two  byte  little-endian value.  This is the number of bytes in
               the data, plus six.

       address Two byte little-endian value.  This is the load address of  the
               data.

       data    The data is simple raw bytes.  There are (length-6) of them.

       checksum
               The checcksum is a single byte.  It is the negative of the sim-
               ple summ of all the header and data bytes.

       If the record length is exactly 6 (_i_._e_. no data), this is the execution
       start address record, indicating the transfer address.

       In addition there may be NUL padding characters between records.  It is
       common for records to be padded so that they start on even byte  bound-
       aries.   In  the days of paper tape, it was common for the file to have
       many leading NULs, to generate blank leader on the tape.

       In general, raw binary data will expand in sized by approximately  1.03
       times when represented with this format.
