       srec_trs80 - Radio Shack TRS-80 object file format specification

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This document describes the binary object file format for the Z80-based
       Radio Shack TRS-80 microcomputers, such as the Model I, II, III, 4, 4D,
       and  4P.   The  binary  format  is  generated  by the disk-based Assem-
       bler/Editor, and used for TRS-DOS program files.

       The object file is blocked into records, each  of  which  contains  the
       record  type,  length,  and  payload  data.   For  Data and End of File
       records, the payload starts with two bytes of address in  little-endian
       format.   There  are  four main types of records that are defined.  The
       record types are:

       +o Data Record

       +o End of File Record with Execution Transfer

       +o End of File Record without Execution Transfer

       +o Comment

       +o Start Linear Address Record (32-bit format only)

       Record Type.
               Each record begins with a single byte Record Type  field  which
               specifies  the  record  type  of  this record.  The Record Type
               field is used to interpret the remaining information within the
               record.  This field is one byte, represented as two hexadecimal
               characters.  The encoding for all the current record types are:

               1  Data Record

               2  End of File Record with Execution Transfer

               3  End of File Record without Execution Transfer

               5  Comment Record

       Record Length
               Each record has a single byte Record Length field which  speci-
               fies  the  number of bytes of information or data which follows
               the Record Length field of the record.  The  maximum  value  of
               the  Record  Length  field  is hexadecimal "FF" or 255.  In the
               case of Data Records only, Record Length byte values of zero to
               two are considered to be lengths of 256 to 258, respectively.

       Address Data  and  End records have a two-byte Address field in little-
               endian byte order.  For Data  records,  this  is  the  starting
               address  at  which to load the remaining payload of the record.
               In End records, this is the address for the start of  execution
               of the file, or zero if not applicable.

       Data    Each  record  has  a variable length Data field, it consists of
               zero or more bytes.  The interpretation of this  field  depends
               on the Record Type field.
