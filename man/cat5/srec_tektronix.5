       srec_tektronix - Tektronix hexadecimal file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  Tektronix  hexadecimal  file  format is no longer very common.  It
       serves a similar purpose to the Motorola  and  Intel  formats,  usually
       used to transfer data into EPROM programmers.

   TThhee LLiinneess
       Most Tektronix hex files contain only Tektronix hex lines (see the next
       section), which always start with a slash  ("/[rq])  character.   There
       are only two types of lines - data lines and a termination line.

   DDaattaa LLiinneess
       Data  lines  have  five  fields:  address, length, checksum 1, data and
       checksum 2.  The lines always start with a slash ("/[rq]) character.

                +--+---------+--------+-----------+------+-----------+
                |/ | Address | Length | Checksum1 | Data | Checksum2 |
                +--+---------+--------+-----------+------+-----------+
       Address This is a 4 character (2 byte) address that specifies where the
               data in the record is to be loaded into memory.

       Data Length
               The  data  length  field  is  a 2 character (1 byte) field that
               specifies the number of character pairs  (bytes)  in  the  data
               field.  This field never has a value of zero.

       Checksum 1
               The  checksum  1  field  is  a 2 character (1 byte) field.  Its
               value is the 8-bit sum of the six 4-bit values  which  make  up
               the address and length fields.

       Data    The  data field contains character pairs (bytes); the number of
               character pairs (bytes) is indicated by the length field.

       Checksum 2
               The checksum 2 field is a 2  character  (1  byte)  field.   Its
               value  is  the least significant byte of the sum of the all the
               4-bit values of the data field.

   TTeerrmmiinnaattiioonn LLiinnee
       Termination lines have three fields: address, zero and  checksum.   The
       lines always start with a slash ("/[rq]) character.

                           +--+---------+------+----------+
                           |/ | Address | Zero | Checksum |
                           +--+---------+------+----------+
       Address This  is a 4 character (2 byte) address that specifies where to
               begin execution.

       Zero    The data length field is a 2 character (1 byte) field of  value
               zero.

       Checksum
               The  checksum  1  field  is  a 2 character (1 byte) field.  Its
               value is the 8-bit sum of the six 4-bit values  which  make  up
               the address and zero fields.

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 2.4 times
       when represented with this format.

       Here is an example Tektronix hex file.  It contains  the  data  "Hello,
       World[rq] to be loaded at address 0.
