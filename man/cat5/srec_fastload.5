       srec_fastload - LSI Logic Fast Load file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  FastLoad  Format uses a compressed ASCII format that permits files
       to be downloaded in less than half  the  time  taken  for  Motorola  S-
       records.

       The  base-64  encoding  used  is "A-Za-z0-9,.".  The data is encoded in
       groups of 4 characters (3 bytes, 24 bits).

       The character '/' is used to introduce  a  special  function.   Special
       functions are:

       A_n_n_n_n_n_n Defines an address.

       B_n_n     Define a single byte.

       C_n_n_n_n   Compare  the  checksums.   The  checksum  is  a simple positive
               16-bit sum, of the data bytes only.

       EAA     Define the program's entry point.  The address will be the cur-
               rent  address  as  defined by the AA command.  (The _A_A number in
               this command is ignored.)  This must be the last entry  in  the
               file.

       KAA     Clear  the  checksum.   (The  _A_A  number  in  this  command  is
               ignored.)

       S_n_a_m_e,X Define a symbol.  The address of the symbol will be the current
               address as defined by the AA command.

       Z_n_n     Clear a number of bytes.

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 1.4 times
       when represented with this format.

       data "Hello, World[rq] to be loaded at address 0.
