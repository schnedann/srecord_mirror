       srec_needham - Needham EMP-series programmer ASCII file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  format  is understood by Needham Electronics' EMP-series program-
       mers.  See www.needhams.com/winman.pdf  for  more  information.   (This
       format  is very similar to the ASCII-Hex format, but without the ^B and
       ^C guard characters.)

       Each data byte is represented as 2 hexadecimal characters, and is sepa-
       rated by white space from all other data bytes.

       The  address for data bytes is set by using a sequence of $A_n_n_n_n, char-
       acters, where _n_n_n_n is  the  8-character  ascii  representation  of  the
       address.   The  comma  is  required.   There  is no need for an address
       record unless there are gaps.  Implicitly, the file starts a address  0
       if no address is set before the first data byte.

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 3.0 times
       when represented with this format.

       Here is an example  ascii-hex  file.   It  contains  the  data  "Hello,
       World[rq] to be loaded at address 0x1000.
