       The file format used for image files is intentionally simple; this per-
       mits you to write a program, such as an assembler, that generates  mem-
       ory  images  that can then be loaded into memory. As an example of this
       file format, if we had a 256-byte memory whose first five bytes were 2,
       3,  0,  20,  and  -1,  and all subsequent values were 0, then the image
       would be the following text file.
              v2.0 raw

              02 03 00 14 ff
       The first line identifies the file format  used  (currently,  there  is
       only  one file format recognized). Subsequent values list the values in
       hexadecimal, starting from address 0; you can place several such values
       on  the  same line. Logisim will assume that any values unlisted in the
       file are zero.

       The image file can use run-length encoding; for  example,  rather  than
       list  the  value  00 sixteen times in a row, the file can include 16*00
       rather than repeat 00 sixteen times. Notice than the number of  repeti-
       tions  is  written  in base 10. Files produced by Logisim will use run-
       length encoding for runs of at least four values

       In general, binary data will expand  in  sized  by  approximately  2.95
       times when represented with this format.

       This format is particularly deficient.

       +o The is no way for changing address in-flight.  And therefore the for-
         mat can't have holes in the data.

       +o There are no checksums, or any other error checking.

       +o There is no provision for a comment header, as distinct to the  "v2.0
         raw" magic number.

       +o There is no provision for an execution start adddress.
