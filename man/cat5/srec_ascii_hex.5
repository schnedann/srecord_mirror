       srec_ascii_hex - Ascii-Hex file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  format  is  also  known as the _A_s_c_i_i_-_S_p_a_c_e_-_H_e_x or _A_s_c_i_i_-_H_e_x_-_S_p_a_c_e
       format.  If you know who invented this format, please let me know.   If
       you  have a better or more complete description, I'd like to know that,
       too.

       The file starts with  a  start-of-text  (STX  or  Control-B)  character
       (0x02).  Everything before the STX is ignored.

       Each  data byte is represented as 2 hexadecimal characters, followed by
       an "execution character".  The default execution character is a  space,
       although many programs which write this format omit the space character
       immediately preceding end-of-line.

       The address for data bytes is set by using a sequence of $A_n_n_n_n,  char-
       acters,  where  _n_n_n_n  is  the  4-character  ascii representation of the
       address.  The comma is required.  There  is  no  need  for  an  address
       record  unless there are gaps.  Implicitly, the file starts a address 0
       if no address is set before the first data byte.

       The file ends with an end-of-text (ETX or Control-C) character  (0x03).
       Everything following the ETX is ignored.

       It  is  also  possible  to  specify  a  running 16-bit checksum using a
       sequence of $S_n_n_n_n, characters, although this usually appears _a_f_t_e_r the
       ETX character and is thus often ignored.

       In  addition  to a space character, the execution character can also be
       percent (%) called "ascii-hex-percent" format, apostrophe (') or  comma
       (,) called "ascii-hex-comma" format.  The file must use the same execu-
       tion character throughout.

       If the execution character is a comma, the address  and  checksum  com-
       mands are terminated by a dot (.) rather than a comma (,).

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 3.0 times
       when represented with this format.

       Here is an example  ascii-hex  file.   It  contains  the  data  "Hello,
       World[rq] to be loaded at address 0x1000.
