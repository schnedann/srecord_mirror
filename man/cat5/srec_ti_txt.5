       srec_ti_txt - Texas Instruments ti-txt (MSP430) file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  ti-TXT format is used by the Texas Instruments MSP430 familty pro-
       gramming adapter.

       The TI-TXT hex format supports 16-bit hexadecimal data.  It consists of
       one or more sections, followed by the end-of-file indicator.

       Each  section  consistes  of  an at (@) sign followed a execution start
       address (in hexadecimal), and newline, and then data bytes (in hexadec-
       imal).   The section address is followed by a newline.  There are to be
       16 data bytes per line, except for the last line in a section.

       The end-of-file indicator is the letter q followed by a  newline.   The
       end-of-file indicator mandatory.

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 3.0 times
       when represented with this format.

       http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau101,  section  A.2.   NNoottee::  the  portion
       which  says  addresses  must be even, and the number of data bytes in a
       section must be even, is wrong.
