       srec_idt - IDT/sim binary file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  format comes from Integrated Device Technology (IDT) System Inte-
       gration Manager (IDT/sim).

       It is almost identical to the Motorola  S-Record  format,  except  that
       most  of  each  record  is  in binary, and there is no line termination
       character.  The 'S' and tag characters are the  same  (ascii),  however
       all other bytes are emitted as binary, rather than as a 2-byte hexadec-
       imal ascii encoding.
