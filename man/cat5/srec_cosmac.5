       srec_cosmac - RCA Cosmac Elf file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  file  takes  the  form of one or more RCA Cosmac Elf monitor com-
       mands, also known as the IDIOT/4 monitor.  Only the change memory  com-
       mand (!M) is allowed.

       The general form of the !M command takes the form
              !M_a_a_a_a _d_d ... _d_d
       The  !M  command writes data byte bytes (represented by character pairs
       _d_d) into successive memory locations, started at address _a_a_a_a.   Spaces
       between data bytes are ignored.

       Using  the  comma (,) line continuation character resumes from the next
       address in sequence.
              !M_a_a_a_a _d_d ... _d_d, _d_d ... _d_d

       Using the semicolon (;) line continuation character takes an address on
       the next line
              !M_a_a_a_a _d_d ... _d_d; _a_a_a_a _d_d ... _d_d

       It  is  also  possible to have the semicolon immediately after the com-
       mand.
              !M; _a_a_a_a _d_d ... _d_d

       All of these forms may be used in combination.

       In general, binary data will expand in size by approximately 2.0  times
       when represented with this format.
