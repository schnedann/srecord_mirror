       srec_brecord - Freescale MC68EZ328 Dragonball bootstrap record format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This data format is understood by Freescale MC68EZ328 Dragonball series
       processors on their internal UART.

   LLiinneess
       Each line contains hexadecimal data, each byte represented by two hexa-
       decimal  nybbles in upper case.  Characters not in this set, but larger
       than 0x30 (e.g. lower case) will be ignored, less than 0x30 (e.g. CR or
       LF) are considered record terminators.  Comments are problematic; don't
       try this at home.

   FFiieellddss
       Each line contains a 4-byte address (big endian), a 1-byte  length-and-
       mode,  and  then  data  bytes  as  dictated by the length.  There is nnoo
       checksum.  A zero length record is an execution start  address  record,
       non-zero length records are data.

                 +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+-----+---+
                 |1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ... | _n |
                 +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+-----+---+
                 |           Address            | Length |  Data   |
                 +------------------------------+--------+---------+
       The length-and-mode byte is formatted as follows:

                           +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                           |7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
                           +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                           |Mode  | R |      Length       |
                           +------+---+-------------------+
       _M_o_d_e    These  bits  are  ignored by SRecord in input (00 = bytes, 01 =
               half words, 10 is reserved, 11 = long words).  These  bits  are
               always zero on output by SRecord.

       _R       This  bit  indicates  a  data  read  rather  than a data write;
               SRecord does not accept input files with this bit set, and will
               not set it on output.

       _L_e_n_g_t_h  The  length of the records data bytes.  It does not include the
               address or length bytes.  The maximum payload of a record is 31
               bytes of data.

   SSiizzee MMuullttiipplliieerr
       In  general,  binary  data  will expand in sized by at least 2.35 times
       when represented with this format.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       Here is an example b-record format file.  It contains the data  "Hello,
       World" to be loaded at address 0.
