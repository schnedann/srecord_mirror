       srec_ppb - Stag Prom Programmer binary format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This is the native binary format of the Stag Prom Programmer.

   FFoorrmmaatt
       The  format  is  packet based.  The packet is somposed of an 0x01 byte,
       the packet payload size (4 bytes, big-endian), the packet address  size
       (4  bytes,  big-endian),  the packet data, and a one-byte simple sum of
       the payload data.

       If the packet payload is more than 1024 bytes, there is an intermediate
       checksum after each 1024th payload pyte.

       The end of file is indicated by a packet with a zero-length payload.

       In  general,  binary  data  will expand in sized by approximately 1.002
       times when represented with this format (worse if there are many  short
       data regions).
