       srec_tektronix_extended - Tektronix Extended hexadecimal file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  format  allows binary files to be uploaded and downloaded between
       two computer systems, typically between a computer system  (such  as  a
       PC,  Macintosh, or workstation) and an emulator or evaluation board for
       microcontrollers and microprocessors.

       Lines always start with a percent (%) character.  Each line consists of
       5  fields.   These  are the length field, the type field, the checksum,
       the address field (including address length), and the data field.

   TThhee FFiieellddss
                   +--+--------+------+----------+---------+------+
                   |% | Length | Type | Checksum | Address | Data |
                   +--+--------+------+----------+---------+------+
       Record Length
               The record length field is a 2 character (1  byte)  field  that
               specifies  the  number of characters (not bytes) in the record,
               excluding the percent.

       Type    The type field is a 1 character field  that  specifies  whether
               the record is data (6) or termination (8).

       Checksum
               The  checksum  is an 2 character (1 byte) field that represents
               the sum of all the nibbles on the line, excluding the checksum.

       Address This is a 9  character  field.   The  first  character  is  the
               address  size; it is always 8.  The remaining 8 chgaracters are
               the 4-byte address that specifies  where  the  data  is  to  be
               loaded into memory.

       Data    The  data  field  contains the executable code, memory-loadable
               data or descriptive information to be transferred.

   RReeccoorrdd TTyyppeess
       6       A record containing data.  The data is placed  at  the  address
               specified.

       8       A termination record.  The address field may optionally contain
               the address of the instruction  to  which  control  is  passed.
               There is no data field.

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 2.5 times
       when represented with this format.

       Here is an example Tektronix  extended  file.   It  contains  the  data
       "Hello, World" to be loaded at address 0x006B.
