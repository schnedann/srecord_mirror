       If you have a URL for documentation of this format, please let me know.

       Any  resemblance  to  the Motorola S-Record is superficial, and extends
       only to the data records.  The header records and  termination  records
       are  completely different.  None of the other Motorola S-Records record
       type are available.

   TThhee RReeccoorrddss
       All records start with an ASCII capital S character, value  0x53,  fol-
       lowed by a type specifier byte.  All records consist of binary bytes.

   TThhee HHeeaaddeerr RReeccoorrdd
       Each file starts with a fixed four byte header record.

                             +-----+------+------+------+
                             |0x53 | 0x30 | 0x30 | 0x33 |

   TThhee DDaattaa RReeccoorrddss
       Each data record consists of 5 fields. These are the type field, length
       field, address field, data field, and the checksum.  The  lines  always
       start with a capital S character.

              +-----+------+---------------+---------+------+----------+
              |0x53 | Type | Record Length | Address | Data | Checksum |
              +-----+------+---------------+---------+------+----------+
       Type    The  type  field is a one byte field that specifies whether the
               record has  a  two-byte  address  field  (0x31),  a  three-byte
               address  field (0x32) or a four-byte address field (0x33).  The
               address is big-endian.

       Record Length
               The record length field is a one byte field that specifies  the
               number of bytes in the record following this byte.

       Address This  is  a  2-,  3- or 4-byte address that specifies where the
               data in the record is to be loaded into memory.

       Data    The data field contains the  executable  code,  memory-loadable
               data or descriptive information to be transferred.

       Checksum
               The checksum is a one byte field that represents the least sig-
               nificant byte of the one's complement of the sum of the  values
               represented  by  the  bytes  making  up  the  record's  length,
               address, and data fields.

       Each file ends with a fixed two byte termination record.

                                    |0x53 | 0x38 |

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 1.2 times
       when represented with this format.

       Here  is  an  hex-dump  example  file.   It  contains  the data "Hello,
       World[rq] to be loaded at address 0.
