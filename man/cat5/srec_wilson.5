       This  is  a mystery format, added to support a mysery EPROM loader used
       by Alan Wilson <dvdsales@dvdlibrary.co.uk>

       If you know the true name of this format, please let me know!  It bears
       a  remarkable similarity to the Motorola S-Record format, however I can
       find no reference to a "compressed" Motorola format.

   TThhee LLiinneess
       Each line contains normal ASCII characters, and "high bit on[rq]  char-
       acters,  but  the ASCII control characters are avoided (the high-bit-on
       con characters are not avoided).  Normal  line  termination  characters
       (CRLF or LF, depending on your system) are used.

       The  presence  of high-bit-on characters makes this format unattractive
       to send via email, as it  must  be  wrapped  as  a  binary  attachment,
       increasing its size.

       In  general,  a  single byte per byte is used to encode values, however
       some values use two bytes, according to the following table:

                        Byte Value    Encoding (1 or 2 chars)
                       0x00 .. 0x9F        0x40 .. 0xDF
                       0xA0 .. 0xAF   0x3A 0x30 .. 0x3A 0x3F
                       0xB0 .. 0xBF   0x3B 0x30 .. 0x3B 0x3F
                       0xC0 .. 0xCF   0x3C 0x30 .. 0x3C 0x3F
                       0xD0 .. 0xDF   0x3D 0x30 .. 0x3D 0x3F
                       oxE0 .. 0xFF        0xE0 .. 0xFF
       The rest of this description, when refering to  "bytes[rq]  means  byte
       values encoded using the above table.

   TThhee FFiieellddss
       Each line consists of 5 fields. These are the type field, length field,
       address field, data field, and the checksum.

                 +-----+---------------+---------+------+----------+
                 |Type | Record Length | Address | Data | Checksum |
                 +-----+---------------+---------+------+----------+
       Type    The type field is a 1 character field  that  specifies  whether
               the record is data (0x43), or termination (0x47).

       Record Length
               The  record  length  field is a 1 byte field that specifies the
               number of bytes in the record, excluding the  type  and  record
               length fields.

       Address This is a 4-byte address that specifies where the data is to be
               loaded into memory.

       Data    The data field contains the  executable  code,  memory-loadable
               data or descriptive information to be transferred.

       Checksum
               The  checksum is an 1-byte field that represents the least sig-
               nificant byte of the one's complement of the sum of the  values
               represented  by  the  bytes  making up the length, address, and
               data fields.

   RReeccoorrdd TTyyppeess
       0x43 (#)
               A record containing data and the 4-byte address  at  which  the
               data is to reside.

       0x47 (')
               A termination record.  The address field may contain the 4-byte
               address of the instruction to which control is  passed.   There
               is no data field.

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 1.5 times
       when represented with this format.
