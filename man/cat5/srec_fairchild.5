       srec_fairchild - Fairchild Fairbug file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The Fairchild Fairbug format has 8-byte records.  A file begins with an
       address record and ends with an end-of-file record.

       There are three record types in this file format.

       Address records are of the form

                                     +--+------+
                                     |S | _n_n_n_n |
       indicating the address for the+-f-o+l-l-o-w-i-n-g+data records.

       Data records are of the form

                             +--+------------------+---+
                             |X | _f_f_f_f_f_f_f_f_f_f_f_f_f_f_f_f | _c |
       Each data record begin+s--w+i-t-h--a-n--X--a-n-d--a-l-w-a-y-s+--c-o+ntains  8  data  bytes.
       The  _f_f  characters  are  hexadecimal byte values (8 bytes).  Each data
       byte is represented by 2 hexadecimal characters.  The _c character is  a
       hex  digit being the the nibble-sum of the data bytes.  A 1-digit hexa-
       decimal checksum follows the data in each data  record.   The  checksum
       represents,  in hexadecimal notation, the sum of the binary equivalents
       of the 16 digits in the record; the half carry from the fourth  bit  is
       ignored.   The  programmer  ignores  any  character (except for address
       characters and the asterisk character, which terminates the data trans-
       fer)  between  a  checksum  and  the  start  character of the next data
       record. This space can be used for comments.

       The end-of-file record has the form

                                         +--+
                                         |* |
       The last record consists of an ast+e-r-i+sk only, which indicates  the  end
       of file.

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 2.4 times
       when represented with this format.

       Here is an example  Fairchild  Fairbug  file.   It  contains  the  data
       "Hello,  World[rq] to be loaded at address 0x1000.  Notice how the last
       record is padded with 0xFF bytes.
