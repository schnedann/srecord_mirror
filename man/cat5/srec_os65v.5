       srec_os65v - OS65V Loader file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  format is used by Ohio Scientific OS65V-compatible loaders.  This
       family of machines includes the OSI C1P, Superboard II, C2, C4, C8, and
       Challenger III, as well as the UK101, and Elektor Junior.

       The  file  startes  with  a  period '.' (0x2E), to ensure address entry
       mode.  then a 4-digit hex address, followed by a slash  '/'  (0X2F)  to
       enter  the  data  entry  mode.   The initial address is always present.
       There is no need for an additional  address  record  unless  there  are
       gaps.

       Each data byte is represented as 2 hexadecimal characters, and is sepa-
       rated by a carriage return character  (0x0D)  (advance  address).   The
       final return character may be omitted.

       The  data  is  concluded  with  a period '.' (0x2E) to re-enter address
       mode.  If an address to start execution is specified, then the  last  5
       bytes  are  _n_n_n_nG where _n_n_n_n is the 4-digit execution address, and G is
       the 'Go' command.

       In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 3.0 times
       when represented with this format.

       Here  is  an  example  ascii-hex  file.   It  contains the data "Hello,
       World[rq] to be loaded at address 0x1000,  with  execution  at  0x1003.
       (On a 6502, this is the opcode for indirect jump to 0x2C6F.)
