       The _s_r_e_c___c_m_p program is used to compare two EPROM load files for equal-
       ity.  This comparison is performed irrespective of the  load  order  of
       the data in each of the files.

       Input  may  be  qualified in two ways: you may specify a data file or a
       data generator.  format and you may specify filters to apply  to  them.
       An input file specification looks like this:
              _d_a_t_a_-_f_i_l_e [ _f_i_l_t_e_r ... ]
              _d_a_t_a_-_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_o_r [ _f_i_l_t_e_r ... ]

   DDaattaa FFiilleess
       Input  from  data  files is specified by file name and format name.  An
       input file specification looks like this:
              _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e [ _f_o_r_m_a_t ][ -ignore-checksums ]
       The default format is Motorola S-Record format,  but  _m_a_n_y  others  are
       also understood.

   DDaattaa GGeenneerraattoorrss
       It  is also possible to generate data, rather than read it from a file.
       You may use a generator anywhere you could use a file.  An input gener-
       ator specification looks like this:
              --GGEENNeerraattee _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_-_r_a_n_g_e --_d_a_t_a_-_s_o_u_r_c_e
       Generators include random data and various forms of constant data.

       See  _s_r_e_c___i_n_p_u_t(1)  for  complete  details  of  input specifiers.  This
       description is in a separate manual page because it is common  to  more
       than one SRecord command.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following options are understood:

       @@_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
               The  named  text file is read for additional command line argu-
               ments.  Arguments are separated by  white  space  (space,  tab,
               newline,  _e_t_c).   There  is no wildcard mechanism.  There is no
               quoting mechanism.  Comments, which start with '##'  and  extend
               to the end of the line, are ignored.  Blank lines are ignored.

       --HHeellpp
               Provide some help with using the _s_r_e_c___c_m_p program.

       --IIGGnnoorree__CChheecckkssuummss
               The  --IIGGnnoorree--CChheecckkssuummss  option  may be used to disable checksum
               validation of input files, for those formats which have  check-
               sums  at  all.  Note that the checksum values are still read in
               and parsed (so it is still an error if they  are  missing)  but
               their  values  are not checked.  Used after an input file name,
               the option affects that file alone; used anywhere else  on  the
               command line, it applies to all following files.

       --EEnnaabbllee__SSeeqquueennccee__WWaarrnniinnggss
               This  option  may  be used to enable warnings about input files
               where the data records are not in  strictly  ascending  address
               order.  Only one warning is issued per input file.  This is the
               default.

               NNoottee:: the output of _s_r_e_c___c_a_t(1) is always in this order.

               NNoottee:: This option must be used _b_e_f_o_r_e the input file.  This  is
               because  if  there  are several files on the command line, each
               may need different settings.   The  setting  remains  in  force
               until the next --DDiissaabbllee__SSeeqquueennccee__WWaarrnniinnggss option.

       --DDiissaabbllee__SSeeqquueennccee__WWaarrnniinnggss
               This  option  may be used to disable warnings about input files
               where the data records are not in  strictly  ascending  address
               order.

               NNoottee:: This option must be used _b_e_f_o_r_e the offending input file.
               This is because if there are several files on the command line,
               each may need different settings.  The setting remains in force
               until the next --EEnnssaabbllee__SSeeqquueennccee__WWaarrnniinnggss option.

       --rreedduunnddaanntt--bbyytteess==_v_a_l_u_e
               Use this option to permit a file to  contain  redundant  values
               for  some  memory locations.  The default is for this condition
               to be a warning.

               ignore
                   No warning or error is issued whena redundant settings  are
                   detected.

               warning
                   A warning is issued when a redundant settings are observed,
                   the warning includes the problematic address.

               error
                   A fatal error is  issued  when  a  redundant  settings  are
                   observed,  the fatal error message includes the problematic
                   address and byte value.

       --ccoonnttrraaddiiccttoorryy--bbyytteess==_v_a_l_u_e
               Use this option to permit a file to contain contradictory  val-
               ues  for some memory locations.  The last value in the input(s)
               will be used.  The default is for this condition to be a  fatal
               error.

               ignore
                   No warning or error is issued when contradictory setting is
                   detected.

               warning
                   A warning is  issued  when  a  vontradictory  settings  are
                   observed, the warning includes the problematic address, and
                   values.

               error
                   A fatal error is issued  when  contradictory  settings  are
                   observed,  the fatal error message includes the problematic
                   address and byte values.

       --VVEERRSSiioonn
               Print the version of the _s_r_e_c___c_m_p program being executed.

       --VVeerrbboossee
               This option may be used to obtain more  information  about  how
               and  where  the  two files differ.  Please note that this takes
               longer, and the output can be voluminous.

       All other options will produce a diagnostic error.

       All options may be abbreviated; the abbreviation is documented  as  the
       upper  case  letters,  all  lower  case letters and underscores (_) are
       optional.  You must use consecutive sequences of optional letters.

       All options are case insensitive, you may type them in  upper  case  or
       lower case or a combination of both, case is not important.

       For example: the arguments "-help", "-HEL" and "-h" are all interpreted
       to mean the --HHeellpp option.  The argument "-hlp" will not be  understood,
       because consecutive optional characters were not supplied.

       Options  and  other  command line arguments may be mixed arbitrarily on
       the command line.

       The GNU long option names are understood.  Since all option  names  for
       _s_r_e_c___c_m_p  are  long,  this  means  ignoring the extra leading "-".  The
       "----_o_p_t_i_o_n==_v_a_l_u_e" convention is also understood.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
       The _s_r_e_c___c_m_p command will exit with a status of 1 on  any  error.   The
       _s_r_e_c___c_m_p  command  will  only  exit  with a status of 0 if there are no
       errors.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       A common use for the _s_r_e_c___c_m_p command is to verify  that  a  particular
       signature is present in the code.  In this example, the signature is in
       a file called "signature[rq], and the EPROM image is in a  file  called
       "image[rq].  We assume they are both Motorola S-Record format, although
       this will work for all formats:
              srec_cmp signature  image -crop -within signature
       The signature need not be at the start of memory, nor need  it  be  one
       single  contiguous piece of memory.  In the above example, the portions
       of the image which have the same address range  as  the  signature  are
       compared with the signature.
